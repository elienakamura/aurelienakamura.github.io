## Welcome to my page /// Aurélie Nakamura

I am currently conducteing a PhD in Social, psychiatric and perinatal epidemiology at INSERM/Sorbonne Université under the supervision of Maria Melchior (Research Director at INSERM) and Judith van der Waerden (Researcher at INSERM). My PhD is entitled _The role of social support during pregnancy in social inequalities in parental postpartum depression_ and it was founded by a doctoral contract from The French School of Public Health (EHESP). In parallel of my research project, I am teaching statistics in the Statistics and Business Intelligence department of IUT Paris Descartes.
